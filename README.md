## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads an image through the web interface.  
2. The system processes the image using an **AI background remover** (e.g., [`rembg`](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) or API).  
3. The processed image is displayed next to the original one.  
4. Users can **download** the new image with the background removed.
